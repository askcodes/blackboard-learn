# Blackboard Learn API setup with AWS (EC2)

This is a guide to setup a Blackboard Learn instance and use it with REST APIs. This process includes 3 steps.

* [Setting up Blackboard AMI EC2 instance on AWS.](#1)
* [Setting up Blackboard developer account.](#2)
* [Linking Blackboard Learn instance and developer account.](#3)


## <a name="1"></a>Setting up Blackboard AMI EC2 instance on AWS 

1. Login to AWS console.
2. Make sure you select `N.Virginia` region from the dropdown and switch to DEV role.
3. Search for and select `EC2` service from search.
4. Navigate to `Instances > Launch Instance`.
    * Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)  
        * Select `AWS Marketplace` from the left panel.
        * Search for "blackboard learn" and choose `Blackboard Learn for REST and LTI Developers` from the results.
        * Hit `Continue`.
    * Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
        * As of January 29, 2021, only `t2.large` and `t2.xlarge` instance types are supported. Select `t2.large`. Hit `Next: Configure Instance Details`.
    * Step 3: Configure Instance Details

    * Step 6: Configure Security Groups

    * Step 7: Review Instance Launch
        * Hit `Launch`.
        * Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair
            * Note that if you select `Choose an existing key pair`, make sure you already have the private key or select `Create a new key pair` and download the private key and save it in a secure location since this will be used to SSH into the instance.
        * Hit `Launch Instances.
5. Your Blackboard instance should be up and running in few minutes.


## <a name="2"></a>Setting up Blackboard developer account 

1. Go to [https://developer.blackboard.com/](https://developer.blackboard.com/) 
2. Signup and Create New Account. 

## <a name="3"></a>Linking Blackboard Learn instance and developer account 

### Register your Blackboard Learn instance 

1. Go to [https://developer.blackboard.com/](https://developer.blackboard.com/) 
2. Login with your account details from [previous step](#2). 
3. Under `Manage Your Applications`, choose `Register`. 
4. Register a New Application    
    * Application Name: blackboard-learn-test
    * Description: Blackboard Learn Test
    * Domain: <- Private IP from your EC2 instance ->
    * Group: Select default one.
    * Hit `Register application and generate API key`.
    * **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to save `Application Key`, `Secret Key`, and `Application ID` in a secure location. We need this information for the next step.
  
### Connect your application to Blackboard Learn instance 
  
1. Go to `https://<-Private IP from your EC2 instance ->/` 
2. Accept risk and continue 
3. Login with
    * USERNAME: `Administrator`
    * PASSWORD: `<- Your EC2's Instance ID ->`
4. Navigate to `System Admin > Integrations > REST API Integrations > Create Integration` 
5. Create Integrations    
    * Application ID: `<- Application ID from Registration above ->`
    * Learn User: `<- Choose a user. Preferably not Administrator. ->`
    * Leave everything else as is.
    * Hit `Submit`
6. Now, everything is set to start making API calls. See below how to. 
  
  
# Making REST API calls

In order to make calls to the Blackboard Learn REST API, we need to authenticate. 

## Authentication ### Generate Basic Token 

1. Base 64 encode `<Application ID>:<Applciation Secret>`
2. The encoded string is your Basic Token.

### Generate Bearer Token

1. POST `https://<- Private IP from your EC2 instance ->/learn/api/public/v1/oauth2/token`
2. Headers
    * *Content-Type:* `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
    * *Authorization*: `Basic <- Basic Token from previous step ->`
3. Form body
    * `grant_type=client_credentials`
4. Expected response:
```json {   "access_token": "2fcz5vM1123456789MQqKQ4YEBd6yFdy3",   "token_type": "bearer",   "expires_in": 3599 } ```

Now, we use this Bearer Token to make requests. See below how to.

## Requests

### Your First Request

1. GET `https://<- Private IP from your EC2 instance ->/learn/api/public/v1/announcements`
2. Headers
    * Content-Type: application/json
    * Authorization: Bearer <- Bearer Token from above ->
3. Expected response:
```json {   "results": [] } ```

### And more...

See [Blackboard REST API Docs](https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi/Learn?version=3800.0.0) for more information.

### Gotchas

1. You may face with invalid certificate issue. You can avoid this by setting up a load balancer for your EC2 instance and attaching a certificate to it.

### Improvements

1. You can setup a custom domain using Route 53 on AWS so you don't have to use your EC2 instance's Private IP every time.
2. Infrastructure as code - Make this setup a CloudFormation stack (EC2 + ALB + SG) so it is easier to manage the instance including launching on demand.
